If a system migration is to be performed; follow these steps:

0- DO NOT MOVE TO THE NEXT STEPS UNTIL THE CURRENT ONE IS COMPLETE AND TESTED

1- Install the OS of choice (Linux Mint, etc); preferably newest fresh install
 ---> Perform whatever needed updates
 ---> Ensure ALL the necessary hardwares are working: especially Nvidia cards (optirun, bumblebee etc)
 ---> Put in all the tools like bashrc, 'expect' etc in this repo where they belong

2- Prepare the coding environment: emacs and latex
 ---> Newest emacs should do, then tack on the .emacs file provided here
 ---> For latex: https://github.com/scottkosty/install-tl-ubuntu is the best known instructions

3- HEP needed tools: install ROOT and other suites
 ---> At least latest 5.34 and 6.xx is needed to run your code and reproduce things
 ---> FastJet could be of interest; Pythia8, MadGraph5, JaxoDraw...
 ---> Sometimes needs a cmake update (e.g. ROOT6); get these as needed

4- Done. Copy the backup files and fingers crossed work can start
